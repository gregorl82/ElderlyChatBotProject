<h1>Memory Keeper ChatBot Application</h1>
<p>A prototype application for elderly people to store important information, built with ReactJS, Dialogflow and Firebase.</p>
<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>According to the latest statistics from the charity AgeUK, 3.6 million older people in the UK live alone, of whom over 
2 million are over the age of 75. Thanks to advances in healthcare, people are living longer but this has put an increased 
on social care. Technology, in particular AI assistance, could be invaluable in helping elderly people stay independent for longer.</p>
<p>The task is to create an application for elderly people to record important information, to help support their day-to-day living.</p>
<h2>MVP</h2>
<p>A user should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use text and/or voice input to record reminders for appointments, exercising or medication</li>
<li>save key information to a database for later recall.</li>
<li>query a Chatbot for guidance on how to navigate around the application and access the stored information</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies used</h2>
<p>This application was built using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ReactJS (front-end framework for manipulating the DOM)</li>
  <li>Dialogflow (an AI chatbot agent that accepts text and voice input )</li>
  <li>Firebase Cloud Firestore (a NoSQL cloud database for storing user input)</li>
  <li>Atom (text editor)</li>
</ul>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the 'client' directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
